Files and code from the paper "On the Optimization of Models for Speech Emotion Recognition", by Dunmore et al.
If you use these files, please cite the following paper:

  Dunmore, A., Gupta, K., Wen, E., Nassani, A., Wang, R., Billinghurst, M. (2025). On the Optimization of Models for Speech Emotion Recognition. 


This code is provided as a minimal working example of the Crawl Space Optimisation method, based on Genetic Algorithms. It also contains a CSV file with corrected timestamps for speech data in the K-EmoCon dataset. 

The dataset can be found here: https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Metadata_record_for_K-EmoCon_a_multimodal_sensor_dataset_for_continuous_emotion_recognition_in_naturalistic_conversations/12618797

If you use the new timestamps, please cite both the above paper, and the K-EmoCon paper:
